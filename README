## Usage


  # when :country parameter is a String,
  # validate as a postal code from a specific country
  validates_as_postal_code :postal_code, :country => 'United States'

  # when :country parameter is a Symbol
  # validate depending on the value of a specific field in the model
  validates_as_postal_code :postal_code, :country => :cardholder_country

### Caveats

Currenty, validates_as_postal_code supports the US, Canada and countries from the EU.
Also, **This is very much beta and things may change**
